Meeting: New Employee Onboarding Process
Date: February 10, 2026
Duration: 45 minutes


Sarah: Welcome everyone to today's training on our employee onboarding process. I'll walk you through each step that HR follows when bringing in a new team member.


Mike: Great, I'm taking notes. Let's start from the beginning.


Sarah: First, when we receive confirmation that a candidate has accepted the offer, we immediately send them a welcome email with their start date and what to expect on day one. This email includes our employee handbook, benefits information, and IT setup instructions.


Mike: How far in advance do we typically send that?


Sarah: Usually one week before their start date. That gives them enough time to review everything but not so much time that they forget the details.


Sarah: Next, we prepare their workspace. This means coordinating with IT to set up their computer, email account, and access to all necessary systems. We also work with facilities to ensure their desk is ready with supplies, monitor, keyboard, and any special equipment they might need.


Mike: What about their first day schedule?


Sarah: Good question. We create a detailed first-day agenda that includes orientation sessions, meetings with their direct manager and team members, and time to get familiar with our tools and processes. We also assign them a buddy from their team who can help answer questions during their first few weeks.


Sarah: Throughout the first week, we schedule training sessions on our core systems: the project management software, time tracking tools, communication platforms, and our documentation system. Each session is about an hour long with hands-on practice time.


Mike: Do we have any paperwork they need to complete?


Sarah: Yes, on day one we have them complete tax forms, direct deposit setup, emergency contact information, and sign our confidentiality agreement. All of this is done electronically through our HR portal to make it easy and paperless.


Sarah: Finally, we conduct check-ins at 30, 60, and 90 days to see how they're adjusting, answer any questions, and gather feedback on how we can improve the onboarding experience. This helps us continuously refine the process.


Mike: This is really comprehensive. Thanks for the walkthrough!


Sarah: My pleasure! Remember, a smooth onboarding process helps new employees feel welcomed and sets them up for success from day one.
