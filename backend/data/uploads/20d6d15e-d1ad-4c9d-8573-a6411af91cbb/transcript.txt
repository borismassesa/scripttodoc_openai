Training Steps
Step 1: Initiating the Employee Onboarding Process
 Overview: 📋You will begin the onboarding process by understanding the initial steps that HR 
follows when bringing in a new team member. This foundational knowledge is crucial for ensuring  
a smooth transition for new employees.
The employee onboarding process is a structured approach that HR utilizes to integrate new hires 
into the organization effectively. It involves several key steps that ensure new team members receive 
the necessary information and resources to start their roles successfully. Understanding this process is 
essential for both HR personnel and managers who will be involved in welcoming new employees. The 
first step in the onboarding process is to initiate the procedure by gathering all relevant documentation 
and resources. This includes preparing welcome materials, setting up necessary accounts, and 
scheduling orientation sessions. By having these elements ready, HR can provide a comprehensive 
introduction to the company culture and expectations, which is vital for new hires to feel welcomed and 
informed.
 Key Actions:✅
1. Initiate: Gather all relevant documentation and resources for the onboarding process.
2. Prepare: Create welcome materials that will be provided to new team members.
3. Schedule: Arrange orientation sessions to introduce new hires to the company culture and 
expectations.

Step 2: Sending Welcome Email to New Hires
 Overview: 📋You will send a welcome email to the candidate who has accepted the offer, 
providing essential information for their first day. This email ensures they are informed and 
prepared before starting.
Upon receiving confirmation that a candidate has accepted the offer, it is crucial to promptly send 
them a welcome email. This email should include their start date and what to expect on day one. 
Additionally, it must contain important documents such as the employee handbook, benefits 
information, and IT setup instructions. Sending this email one week before their start date allows the 
new hire sufficient time to review the materials without overwhelming them with too much information 
too early.
 Key Actions:✅
1. **Send**: Dispatch the welcome email to the candidate, including their start date and expectations for 
day one.
2. **Include**: Attach the employee handbook, benefits information, and IT setup instructions in the 
email.
3. **Schedule**: Ensure the email is sent one week prior to the candidate's start date for optimal 
preparation time.

Step 3: Creating a Detailed First-Day Agenda
 Overview: 📋You will establish a comprehensive first-day agenda that facilitates a smooth 
onboarding experience for new team members. This agenda will include orientation sessions, 
meetings, and time for familiarization with tools and processes.
A well-structured first-day agenda is crucial for helping new hires acclimate to their roles and the 
company culture. It sets the tone for their experience and ensures they have the necessary resources to 
succeed from day one. The agenda should include orientation sessions that introduce them to the 
company’s mission, values, and key policies. Additionally, scheduling meetings with their direct manager  
and team members fosters early connections and clarifies expectations. Incorporating time for new hires  
to get familiar with tools and processes is essential. This allows them to explore the systems they will be 
using and ask questions in a supportive environment. Assigning a buddy from their team is another 
effective strategy; this person can provide guidance and answer questions during the first few weeks, 
enhancing the new hire's comfort level and integration into the team.
 Key Actions:✅
1. **Create**: A detailed first-day agenda that includes orientation sessions and meetings with the direct 
manager and team members.
2. **Assign**: A buddy from the team to assist the new hire during their first few weeks.

3. **Include**: Time for the new hire to get familiar with tools and processes to ensure they are well-
prepared.

Step 4: Completing Required Paperwork Electronically
 Overview: 📋Readers will complete essential paperwork electronically through the HR portal on 
day one of training. This process ensures a paperless and efficient onboarding experience.
Completing the necessary paperwork is a critical step in the onboarding process for new technical 
users. On the first day, new hires will be required to fill out tax forms, set up direct deposit, provide 
emergency contact information, and sign a confidentiality agreement. This paperwork is essential for 
compliance and ensures that all necessary information is collected from the start. Using the HR portal 
streamlines this process, allowing new employees to complete everything electronically. This not only 
reduces the need for physical paperwork but also enhances the efficiency of onboarding by allowing 
new hires to focus on their training sessions. Each session lasts about an hour and includes hands-on 
practice time, making it important that all administrative tasks are completed promptly to maximize 
learning opportunities.
 Key Actions:✅
1. Navigate: Access the HR portal to begin the paperwork process.
2. Complete: Fill out the tax forms and direct deposit setup electronically.
3. Provide: Enter your emergency contact information as required.
4. Sign: Agree to the confidentiality agreement electronically.
________________________________________________________________________________
Step 5: Conduct Check-Ins at 30, 60, and 90 Days
 Overview: 📋You will establish regular check-ins to assess new employees' adjustment and 
gather feedback for improving the onboarding experience.
Conducting check-ins at 30, 60, and 90 days is crucial for ensuring that new employees feel 
welcomed and supported in their transition. These meetings provide an opportunity to answer any 
questions the new hires may have and to gather valuable feedback on the onboarding process. By 
actively engaging with new employees during these intervals, you can identify areas for improvement 
and make necessary adjustments to enhance their experience. This approach not only fosters a positive 
work environment but also sets the stage for long-term success from day one.
 Key Actions:✅
1. Schedule: Arrange check-ins at 30, 60, and 90 days post-onboarding.
2. Prepare: Develop a list of questions to address during each check-in.
3. Collect: Gather feedback from new employees on their onboarding experience.
